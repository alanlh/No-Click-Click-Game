# The No Click Click Game

An Android game I created for my final project in CS126 but am continuing to work on. 

Players click buttons to earn points, but with the catch that only 1 button can be clicked per 30 minutes.
Button values increment every second, but reset to 0 after being clicked. 

12/23/2017: Basic game works, but very unpolished and cheatable.
